# Numerical Methods Optimization Project

This project implements numerical methods like LU factorization and iterative improvement to analyze the convergence and stability of solving large linear systems in MATLAB.

It was developed as a project for numerical analysis and optimization. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in mathematical and matrix programming.

To run, simply execute the MATLAB code in MATLAB R20XX or later. No additional dependencies are required.

The project computes LU factorization using partial pivoting to decompose the matrix. It then performs iterative improvement to refine the solution.

Relative error metrics and residuals are calculated to evaluate the performance of the numerical techniques.

The code exercises core competencies like numerical programming, matrix analysis, optimization, and testing that are relevant for computer vision and optical engineering roles.

Potential improvements could include testing other matrix decompositions like QR or implementing in lower-level languages like C++.

This project utilizes MATLAB R20XX.
